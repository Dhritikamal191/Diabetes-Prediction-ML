- Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
- 768 records
- 8 features
- Target: Diabetes (0=No, 1=Yes)
# Steps Performed
- Data Cleaning
- Missing Value Handling
- Feature Regression
- Balanced Logistic Regression
- ROC-AUC Analysis
# Results
- Best Model: Balanced Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: 77.9%
- ROC-AUC Score: 81.3%
# Key  Insight
Glucose level is the strongest predictor of diabetes.
